      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Napend is a internet company. Founded in only November 2015, we have a long history. In January 2016, Alex Munoz had some coding chats online, and made a friend. He hired that friend, known as Yassine, to the company. After doing hard work, Alex promoted Yassine to Vice President. In July of 2016, Alex did not love owning a company as much as he use to, so he hired a new CEO. The CEO re-hired Alex as CEO, and quit. Although he quit, he still has interest in the company. Now, in November 2016, we sell websites. We have fired and hired many people, but we keep very few.</p>
